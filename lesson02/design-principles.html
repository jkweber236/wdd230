                This webpage exemplifies the principle of alignment because its elements
                are arranged in an organized and consistent manner. Each widget is aligned
                both horizontally and vertically with the other widgets. The text corresponding
                with each one is also center aligned, indicating that they are related in some way.
                The structure of the pieces on the page gives them a clear visual connection.

            <p>
                This webpage is a great example of contrast because it has
                light-colored text against a dark background. The utilization of
                this design principle helps to increase the visibility of the content
                on the page and improves the visual appeal. Additionally, the simplicity
                of the page further aids with its contrast as it puts an emphasis on the
                most important aspects.

            <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
            <p id="name">Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</p>

            <p>
                This church webpage is an example of the rule of thirds because of the main image
                on the page. The focus is on the child's face which is positioned at the intersection
                of the (imaginary) grid lines, following the rule of thirds principle. The surrounding
                elements are also carefully arranged to further complement and emphasize the main subject.
                This gives the design a balanced and visually appealing composition.

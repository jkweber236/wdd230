            <h2>Mosiah 2:41</h2>
            <p>
                And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state
                of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all
                things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they
                are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending
                happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.

            <h2>Alma 24:14</h2>
            <p>
                And the great God has had mercy on us, and made these things known unto us that we might not
                perish; yea, and he has made these things known unto us beforehand, because he loveth our souls
                as well as he loveth our children; therefore, in his mercy he doth visit us by his angels, that
                the plan of salvation might be made known unto us as well as unto future generations.
